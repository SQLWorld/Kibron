        </header>

    <div class = "intro">
        <p> Kebron is a decent person, well atleast that's what I like to believe. As of now,
            I have enough confidence in myself to say that I'm a smart student, I think that's what 
            I take pride in the most, I mean, what am I if not my good grades? Actually strach that, 
            as I write this, I think about what I love the most, my family. My mom, who is my number one
            supporter and would do anything for me, my dad, a hard-worker who always tries even one
            odds are against him, and my sister, who I look up to in times of need. As a 15-year old 
            high school student, my life revolves around the people that push me to be who I am today,
            and I couldn't be more greatful for it. </p>

        <p>I'm a sophomore at Paint Branch. I love my culture, which is why I'm an active participant
            in the Ethiopian Eritrean Student Association, where we learn about our culture as habeshas
            and connect with other Ethiopians. I also participate in extracurricular activities such as 
            managing lacrosse and playing field hockey. I love volunteering in ways where I can meet new
            people, which is why I participate in activites such as managing lacrosse.

            <p> Besides my straight A's, I was a member of the National Junior Honors Society,
                I have 75 SSL hours, and I am apart of Ethiopian Eritrean Student Association 
                (EESA). I plan to use these achievements and make more so that I can become a 
                computer scientist.
